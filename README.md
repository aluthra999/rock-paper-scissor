# rock-paper-scissor
Rock-Paper-Scissors - Python game (terminal based)

In this code, the determine_winner() function takes the player's choice and computer's choice as input and determines the winner based on the rock-paper-scissors rules. The play_game() function prompts the player for their choice, validates it, randomly generates the computer's choice, and then calls the determine_winner() function to determine the winner and display the result.

The game will keep running until the user enters 'q' to quit. After each round, the program will prompt the user for another choice or the option to quit. If the user enters 'q', the loop will break and the game will end.

The variables wins, losses, and ties are introduced to keep track of the corresponding outcomes. After the user decides to quit the game, the program will display the final results including the number of wins, losses, and ties.
